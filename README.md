# Angels We Have Heard On High   
   
Angels we have heard on high   
Sweetly singing o’er the plains   
And the mountains in reply,   
Echoing their joyous strains.   
   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
   
Shepherds, why this Jubilee?   
Why your joyous strains prolong?   
What the gladsome tidings be   
Which inspire your heavenly song?   
   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
   
Come to Bethlehem and see   
Him whose birth the angels sing;   
Come, adore on bended knee   
Christ, the Lord,   
The newborn King   
   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
Glo-ori-a   
In excelsis de-o   
   
   
# Away in a Manger   
   
Away in a manger,   
No crib for His bed,   
The little Lord Jesus   
Laid down His sweet head;   
The stars in the heavens   
Looked down where He lay,   
The little Lord Jesus   
Asleep on the hay.   
   
The cattle are lowing,   
The poor Baby wakes,   
But little Lord Jesus,   
No crying He makes.   
I love Thee, Lord Jesus;   
Look down from the sky   
And stay by my cradle   
Till morning is nigh.   
   
Be near me, Lord Jesus;   
I ask Thee to stay   
Close by me forever   
And love me I pray!   
Bless all the dear children   
In Thy tender care,   
And fit us for Heaven   
To live with Thee there.

Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la   
’Tis the season to be jolly   
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

While I tell of Yule-tide treasure.

# Do You Hear What I Hear?   
   
Said the night wind to the little lamb,   
Do you see what I see   
Way up in the sky, little lamb,   
Do you see what I see   
A star, a star, dancing in the night   
With a tail as big as a kite   
With a tail as big as a kite   
   
Said the little lamb to the   
shepherd boy,   
Do you hear what I hear   
Ringing through the sky,   
shepherd boy,   
Do you hear what I hear   
A song, a song, high above the trees   
With a voice as big as the sea   
With a voice as big as the sea   
   
Said the shepherd boy to the   
mighty king,   
Do you know what I know   
In your palace warm, mighty king,   
Do you know what I know   
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold   
Let us bring Him silver and gold   
Let us bring Him silver and gold   
   
Said the king to the people   
everywhere,   
Listen to what I say   
Pray for peace, people everywhere!   
Listen to what I say   
The Child, the Child, sleeping in   
the night   
He will bring us goodness and light   
He will bring us goodness and light   
   
   
# Frosty the Snowman   
   
Frosty the snowman was a jolly   
happy soul,   
With a corncob pipe and a button nose   
And two eyes made out of coal.   
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale,   
they say,   
He was made of snow but the children   
Know how he came to life one day.   
   
There must have been some magic   
in that old silk hat they found.   
For when they placed it on his head   
He began to dance around.   
   
O, Frosty the snowman   
Was alive as he could be,   
And the children say he could laugh   
And play just the same as you and me.   
   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Look at Frosty go.   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Over the hills of snow.   
   
Frosty the snowman knew   
The sun was hot that day,   
So he said, “Let’s run and   
We’ll have some fun   
Now before I melt away.”   
   
Down to the village,   
With a broomstick in his hand,   
Running here and there all   
Around the square saying,   
Catch me if you can.   
   
He led them down the streets of town   
Right to the traffic cop.   
And he only paused a moment when   
He heard him holler “Stop!”   
   
For Frosty the snow man   
Had to hurry on his way,   
But he waved goodbye saying,   
“Don’t you cry,   
I’ll be back again some day.”   
   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Look at Frosty go.   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Thumpety thump thump,   
Over the hills of snow.   
   
   
# Go, Tell it on the Mountain   
   
While shepherds kept their watching   
Over silent flocks by night,   
Behold throughout the heavens,   
There shone a holy light:   
   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,   
Over the hills and everywhere;   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain   
That Jesus Christ is born.   
   
The shepherds feared and trembled   
When lo! above the earth   
Rang out the angel chorus   
That hailed our Saviour’s birth:   
   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,   
Over the hills and everywhere;   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain   
That Jesus Christ is born.   
   
Down in a lowly manger   
Our humble Christ was born   
And God sent us salvation,   
That blessed Christmas morn:   
   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,   
Over the hills and everywhere;   
Go, Tell It On The Mountain   
That Jesus Christ is born.   
   
   
# God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen   
   
God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,   
Let nothing you dismay;   
Remember Christ, our Saviour,   
Was born on Christmas day,   
To save us all from Satan’s power   
When we were gone astray.   
O tidings of comfort and joy,   
Comfort and joy,   
O tidings of comfort and joy.   
   
In Bethlehem, in Jewry,   
This blessed Babe was born,   
And laid within a manger,   
Upon this blessed morn;   
That which His Mother Mary,   
Did nothing take in scorn.   
O tidings of comfort and joy,   
Comfort and joy,   
O tidings of comfort and joy.   
   
From God our Heavenly Father,   
A blessed Angel came;   
And unto certain Shepherds   
Brought tidings of the same:   
How that in Bethlehem was born   
The Son of God by Name.   
O tidings of comfort and joy,   
Comfort and joy,   
O tidings of comfort and joy.

# Holly Jolly Christmas   
   
Have a holly, jolly Christmas;   
It’s the best time of the year   
I don’t know if there’ll be snow,   
But have a cup of cheer.   
Have a holly, jolly Christmas;   
And when you walk down the street   
Say Hello to friends you know   
And everyone you meet.   
   
Oh, ho, the mistletoe   
Hung where you can see;   
Somebody waits for you;   
Kiss her once for me.

I’ll be home for Christmas   
If only in my dreams   
   
   
   
# It Came Upon The Midnight Clear   
   
It came upon the midnight clear,   
That glorious song of old,   
From angels bending near the earth   
With news of joy foretold,   
“Peace on the earth, good will to men   
From heaven’s all gracious King.”   
The world in solemn stillness lay,   
To hear the angels sing.   
   
Still through the cloven skies they   
come,   
Love’s banner all unfurled;   
And still their heavenly music floats   
Over all the weary world.   
Above its sad and lowly plains   
Old echoes plaintive ring,   
And ever over its Babel sounds   
The blessed angels sing.   
   
   
   
# It’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year   
   
It’s the most wonderful time of the year.   
With the kids jingle belling,   
And everyone telling you,   
“Be of good cheer,”   
It’s the most wonderful time of the year.   
There’ll be parties for hosting,   
Marshmallows for toasting and   
Caroling out in the snow.   
There’ll be scary ghost stories and   
Tales of the glories of Christmases   
Long, long ago.   
It’s the most wonderful time of the year.   
There’ll be much mistletoeing   
And hearts will be glowing,   
When loved ones are near.   
It’s the most wonderful time of the year.   
   
   
# Jingle Bells   
   
Dashing through the snow   
On a one-horse open sleigh,   
Over the fields we go,   
Laughing all the way;   
Bells on bob-tail ring,   
Making spirits bright,   
What fun it is to ride and sing   
A sleighing song tonight   
   
Jingle bells, jingle bells,   
Jingle all the way!   
O what fun it is to ride   
In a one-horse open sleigh   
   
A day or two ago,   
I thought I’d take a ride,   
And soon Miss Fanny Bright   
Was seated by my side;   
The horse was lean and lank;   
Misfortune seemed his lot;   
He got into a drifted bank,   
And we, we got upsot.   
   
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,   
Jingle all the way!   
What fun it is to ride   
In a one-horse open sleigh.   
   
   
# Joy to the World   
   
Joy to the world! the Lord is come;   
Let earth receive her King;   
Let every heart prepare Him room,   
and heaven and nature sing,   
and heaven and nature sing,   
and heaven, and heaven and   
nature sing.   
   
Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns;   
Let men their songs employ;   
while fields and floods,   
rocks, hills and plains   
Repeat the sounding joy,   
Repeat the sounding joy,   
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.   
   
No more let sins and sorrows grow,   
nor thorns infest the ground;   
He comes to make His blessing flow   
far as the curse is found,   
far as the curse is found,   
far as, far as the curse is found.   
   
He rules the world with truth   
and grace,   
and makes the nations prove   
the glories of His righteousness,   
and wonders of His love,   
and wonders of His love,   
and wonders, wonders of His love.   
   
   
   
# Let It Snow!   
   
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,   
But the fire is so delightful,   
And since we’ve no place to go,   
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.   
   
It doesn’t show signs of stopping,   
And I brought some corn for popping;   
The lights are turned way down low,   
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.   
   
When we finally say good night,   
How I’ll hate going out in the storm;   
But if you really hold me tight,   
All the way home I’ll be warm.   
   
The fire is slowly dying,   
And, my dear, we’re still good-bye-ing,   
But as long as you love me so.   
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

A new and glorious morn.

O little town of Bethlehem,   
How still we see thee lie.   
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   
The silent stars go by;   
Yet in thy dark streets shineth   
The everlasting Light;   
The hopes and fears of all the years   
Are met in thee tonight.   
   
For Christ is born of Mary,   
And, gathered all above   
While mortals sleep, the angels keep   
Their watch of wondering love.   
O morning stars, together   
Proclaim the holy birth.   
And praises sing to God the King.   
And peace to men on earth.

You know Dasher and Dancer   
And Prancer and Vixen,   
Comet and Cupid   
And Donner and Blitzen.   
But do you recall   
The most famous reindeer of all?   
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer   
(reindeer)   
Had a very shiny nose   
(like a light bulb)   
And if you ever saw it   
(saw it)   
You would even say it glows   
(like a flash light)   
All of the other reindeer   
(reindeer)   
Used to laugh and call him names   
(like Pinocchio)   
They never let poor Rudolph   
(Rudolph)   
Play in any reindeer games   
(like Monopoly)   
Then one foggy Christmas Eve   
Santa came to say   
(Ho Ho Ho)   
Rudolph with your nose so bright   
Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?   
Then all the reindeer loved him   
(loved him)   
And they shouted out with glee   
(yippee)   
“Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer   
(reindeer)   
You’ll go down in history!”   
(like Columbus)

# The First Noel   
   
The first Noel the angels did say   
Was to certain poor shepherds   
In fields as they lay,   
In fields where they lay   
Keeping their sheep   
On a cold winter’s night   
That was so deep.   
Noel Noel Noel Noel!   
Born is the King of Israel!   
   
They looked up and saw a star   
Shining in the East beyond them far,   
And to the earth it gave great light,   
And so it continued both day and night.   
Noel Noel Noel Noel!   
Born is the King of Israel!   
   
And by the light of that same star   
Three wise men came from country far,   
To seek for a King was their intent   
And to follow the star   
Wherever it went.   
Noel Noel Noel Noel!   
Born is the King of Israel!

Up on the housetop,   
Click, click, click,   
Down thru’ the chimney   
With good Saint Nick.   
   
   
   
# We Three Kings Of Orient Are   
   
We three kings of orient are,   
Bearing gifts we traverse afar   
Field and fountain,   
Moor and mountain,   
Following yonder star.   
   
O star of wonder, star of night,   
Star with royal beauty bright.   
Westward leading, still proceeding,   
Guide us to thy perfect light.   
   
Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain,   
Gold I bring to crown Him again   
King for ever, ceasing never   
Over us all to reign.   
   
O star of wonder, star of night,   
Star with royal beauty bright.   
Westward leading, still proceeding,   
Guide us to thy perfect light.   
   
Frankincense to offer have I,   
Incense owns a Deity nigh   
Prayer and praising, all men raising,   
Worship Him, God most high.   
   
O star of wonder, star of night,   
Star with royal beauty bright.   
Westward leading, still proceeding,   
Guide us to thy perfect light.

# What Child Is This?   
   
What Child is this, who laid to rest,   
On Mary’s lap is sleeping?   
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet   
While shepherds watch are keeping?   
This, this is Christ the King   
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.   
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,   
The Babe, the Son of Mary.   
   
Why lies He in such mean estate   
Where ox and ass are feeding?   
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here,   
The silent Word is pleading.   
This, this is Christ the King   
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.   
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,   
The Babe, the Son of Mary.   
   
Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through,   
The Cross be borne, for me, for you:   
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh,   
The Babe, the Son of Mary!   
This, this is Christ the King   
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.   
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,   
The Babe, the Son of Mary.   
   
   
# White Christmas   
   
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas   
Just like the ones I used to know   
Where the treetops glisten   
And children listen   
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.   
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas   
With every Christmas card I write   
May your days be merry and bright   
And may all your Christmases be white.   
   
   
# Winter Wonderland   
   
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,   
In the lane, snow is glistening   
A beautiful sight,   
We’re happy tonight,   
Walking in a winter wonderland.   
   
Gone away is the bluebird,   
Here to stay is a new bird   
He sings a love song,   
As we go along,   
Walking in a winter wonderland.   
   
In the meadow we can build a snowman,   
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown   
He’ll say: Are you married?   
We’ll say: No man,   
But you can do the job   
When you’re in town.   
   
Later on, we’ll conspire,   
As we dream by the fire   
To face unafraid,   
The plans that we’ve made,   
Walking in a winter wonderland.   
   
In the meadow we can build a snowman,   
And pretend that he’s a circus clown   
We’ll have lots of fun with mister snowman,   
Until the other kids knock him down.   
   
When it snows, ain’t it thrilling,   
Though your nose gets a chilling   
We’ll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,   
Walking in a winter wonderland.   
Walking in a winter wonderland,   
Walking in a winter wonderland.
