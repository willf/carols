<p>In the meadow we can build a snowman,<br>Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>He’ll say: Are you married?<br>We’ll say: No man,<br>But you can do the job<br>When you’re in town.   </p>
<p>Later on, we’ll conspire,<br>As we dream by the fire<br>To face unafraid,<br>The plans that we’ve made,<br>Walking in a winter wonderland.   </p>
<p>In the meadow we can build a snowman,<br>And pretend that he’s a circus clown<br>We’ll have lots of fun with mister snowman,<br>Until the other kids knock him down.   </p>
<p>When it snows, ain’t it thrilling,<br>Though your nose gets a chilling<br>We’ll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,<br>Walking in a winter wonderland.<br>Walking in a winter wonderland,<br>Walking in a winter wonderland.</p>
